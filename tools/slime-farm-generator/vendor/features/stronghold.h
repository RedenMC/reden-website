/**
 * Generate the structure pieces of a Stronghold. The maximum number of pieces
 * that are generated is limited to 'n'. A buffer length of around 400 should
 * be sufficient in practice, but a stronghold can in theory contain many more
 * than that. The number of generated pieces is given by the return value.
 *
 * This code does not adjust the Y-coordinate of the pieces, so the starting
 * piece will always be at Y=64. This can be enabled by removing the
 * `mc <= MC_1_12_2 && !env.portal` check, and additionally removing
 * `&& !env.generationStopped` from the `while (list->next)` loop. The reason
 * this code is not executed by default is that the Y-coordinate is not
 * relevant (for the most part) for loot/eye generation.
 *
 * This function does not compute loot seeds or portal room eye count, use
 * `getStrongholdLoot` for that.
 *
 * @param list the pieces list
 * @param n the maximum number of pieces to generate
 * @param mc the Minecraft version
 * @param seed the world seed (lower 48 bits suffice)
 * @param chunkX the chunk X-coordinate
 * @param chunkZ the chunk Z-coordinate
 * @return the number of pieces that were generated
